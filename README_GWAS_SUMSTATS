# BMI GWAS Results

This repository contains the results of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) for Body Mass Index (BMI) across different age brackets and sexes.

## File Description

This repository contains 12 individual compressed GWAS result files for BMI, separated by sex and age brackets. Each file follows this naming convention:

- `bmi_[age_bracket]_[sex].sumstats.gz`

Where:
- `[sex]` is either `f` (female) or `m` (male)
- `[age_bracket]` is one of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, or `f`

The age brackets correspond to the following age ranges:

- a: 40-45 years
- b: 46-50 years
- c: 51-55 years
- d: 56-60 years
- e: 61-65 years
- f: 66-73 years

## File Sizes

The individual .gz files can be quite large. For example:

- `bmi_b_f.sumstats.gz` is approximately 15MB in size.

Other files may vary in size, but users should expect files in the range of 10-20MB each.

## File Content

Each .gz file contains the following columns:

1. SNP: The rsID of the SNP
2. A1: The effect allele
3. A2: The non-effect allele
4. OR: The odds ratio (effect size)
5. P: The p-value of the association

## How to Use

1. Download the .gz file(s) you're interested in.

2. Unzip each .gz file:
   ```
   gunzip bmi_b_f.sumstats.gz
   ```

3. Now you can read each file using your preferred data analysis tool. For example, in R:
   ```R
   data <- read.table("bmi_b_f.sumstats", header = TRUE)
   ```

4. Note that the p-values in the files are -log10 transformed. To get the actual p-value, you need to perform this transformation:
   ```R
   data$P <- 10^(-data$P)
   ```

## Checking File Sizes

To check the size of any of the .gz files, you can use the following Unix command:

```
ls -lh filename.gz
```

Or for more detailed information:

```
du -h filename.gz
```

## Additional Information

- The GWAS was performed using 40 principal components for population stratification control.
- The data is from the UK Biobank (Application 23704).
- Due to the large file sizes, ensure you have sufficient disk space before extracting the files.
- For any questions or issues, please open an issue in this repository.
