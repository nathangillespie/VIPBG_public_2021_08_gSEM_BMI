# BMI GWAS Results

This repository contains the results of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) for Body Mass Index (BMI) across different age brackets and sexes.

## File Description

The compressed files contain GWAS results for BMI, separated by sex and age brackets. Each file follows this naming convention:

- `ln_bmi_t6_[sex]_[age_bracket]_beta.gz`

Where:
- `[sex]` is either `female` or `male`
- `[age_bracket]` is one of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, or `f`

The age brackets correspond to the following age ranges:

- a: 40-45 years
- b: 46-50 years
- c: 51-55 years
- d: 56-60 years
- e: 61-65 years
- f: 66-73 years

## File Content

Each file contains the following columns:

1. SNP: The rsID of the SNP
2. A1: The effect allele
3. A2: The non-effect allele
4. OR: The odds ratio (effect size)
5. P: The p-value of the association

## How to Use

1. Unzip the files using a tool like gunzip:
   ```
   gunzip ln_bmi_t6_female_a_beta.gz
   ```

2. You can then read the file using your preferred data analysis tool. For example, in R:
   ```R
   data <- read.table("ln_bmi_t6_female_a_beta", header = TRUE)
   ```

3. Note that the p-values in the files are -log10 transformed. To get the actual p-value, you need to perform this transformation:
   ```R
   data$P <- 10^(-data$P)
   ```

## Additional Information

- The GWAS was performed using 40 principal components for population stratification control.
- The data is from the UK Biobank (Application 23704).
